# bootleg-files

This is where a whole bunch of "helper files" will reside. These files will be helpful when making bootleg covers.

UPDATE: 11/21/18

Added a bunch of assets provided by Tim1218 over on the GreasyLake forums. The following tours were added:

* Born in the USA - Template and font
* Devils and Dust - Background, Logo, and fonts - also there are notes on making covers and how to achieve certain effects.
* High Hopes - Template, Logo and Fonts
* Magic - Logos and Font
* Tom Joad - Template and Fonts
* The Rising - Background - Closest font is Impact which is preinstalled on most computers. Just change the width to 80% in photoshop. (https://snag.gy/1rMld2.jpg)
* Working on a Dream - Template and Logo
* Wrecking Ball - Template and MANY logos. Custom font made by yours truly.
* Fonts - This is where a bunch of other fonts are.
* Logos - Album logos that don't fit elsewhere on this list.

As time goes on, I will add more templates and what not. If there is interest, I'll make some guides on making bootleg covers.
