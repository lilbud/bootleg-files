# bootleg-files

This is where a whole bunch of "helper files" will reside. These files will be helpful when making bootleg covers.

UPDATE: 11/21/18

Added a bunch of assets provided by Tim1218 over on the GreasyLake forums. The following tours were added:

* Born in the USA - Template and font
* Devils and Dust - Background, Logo, and fonts
